## Project Title : Fake News Detection using Machine Learning & Deep Learning techniques.

Technologies Used

Libraries: NLTK, Scikit-learn, tensorflow, Flask, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Languages: Python

Deployment: Flask, Pickle

The main aim of this project is to identify the news articles whether it is fake or true news based on text. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and both machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict the fake news. Therefore, misinformation can be reduced.

The project follows several steps:

**Data Preprocessing:** handled missing data, Text cleaning, Text normalization, Removed stop words, Tokenization, Stemming, Lemmatization and feature engineering to prepare the data.

**EDA**: performed univariant and bivariant analysis.

**Text Vectorization**:TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)

**Machine Learning Models:** Trained and evaluated multiple models like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Naive Bayes.

**Deep Learning Approach:** Integrated a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to capture sequential patterns and context in textual data.

**Model Evaluation:** Evaluated models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score and confusion matrix.

**Deployment**: Saved the trained Logistic Regression model using pickle for deployment.
